# data(5,:) is y-position of the visual pattern
# data(6,:) is 2-photon frame synchronization signal (1 pulse corresponds to 1 frame)
# data(7,:) is behavior camera signal (1 pulse corresponds to 1 frame)
# data(8,:) indicates the start of a stimulus (it is empty in this example)

# Questions for the meeting on 2024-11-06
* The data that you shared with us? is this associated with a paper? is this something you are interested on sharing on dandi? What are the expectations of the code 
* The tiff format, what kind of microscope is it? Scanimage? If you could send me the model that would be useful.
* How is the stimuli presented? That is, I have two images, are they presented on time?`
